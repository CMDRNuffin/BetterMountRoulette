# BetterMountRoulette
Better mount roulette plugin for FFXIV

Allows for a more granular approach to selecting the mounts you want included in your mount roulette instead of the very binary "up to 30" and "EVERYTHING!!!!" options the game gives us.

## Known Bugs
None currently. Yay.

## Roadmap
Things I intend to implement at some point in the future. Before posting a feature request, please make sure it's not already listed here:

- Group mounts to treat as a single mount. Got 85 different flavours of "horse" but only the company chocobo otherwise? Put the horses in a group and treat it as a single mount for a 50/50 chance of getting "a random horse" or the chocobo.
- Summon criteria
  - Summon mount with specified number of seats (to move the whole party). (currently being worked on)
  - Summon mount with/without custom BGM.
  - Summon fastest mount (i.e. SDS Fenrir if owned and riding map not unlocked, random otherwise)
  - Maybe more
- Search function for the settings, so you can finally disable that one eyesore of a mount you just can't seem to find without it.
- Customizable rarities (for when you like some mounts less than others, but not enough to disable them outright)
- A way to get the Flying Mount Roulette back if you deleted it from your hotbar (or never got it in the first place because you started late, like me)
